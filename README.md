## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- I learned how to use tailwind css

Install **Tailwind CSS** via npm and create **tailwind.config.js** file

```javascript
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Start the Tailwind CLI build process

```javascript
npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

### Continued development

- Combine Tailwind with React

### Useful resources
